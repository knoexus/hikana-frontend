### Trivia

Hikana is a web application aimed at helping people learn Japanese Hiragana & Katakana with a number of auxiliary tools at their disposal. The tools are not strictly limited to serving as helpers in learning certain characters. They also allow users to understand words they are dealing with as well as practise spelling words they have learned elsewhere and more.
